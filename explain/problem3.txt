Need to use heap (priority queue), because when we get 2 items from heap and put 1 new item back . We need to make sure every items are sorted.

Assume that method heappop/heappush have big O: O(1)
Big O of function:
generate_frequency_dic (line 74): O(n)
generate_code_from_tree (line 45): O(n)

huffman_encoding: worst case (all characters are different): O(n)+O(n)+O(n)=>O(n)

huffman_decoding: O(n)
