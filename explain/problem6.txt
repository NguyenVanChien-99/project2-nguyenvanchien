Union

I use SET and put all items of list 1 and 2 to this one because Set will remove all duplicate items
and then put the items of set back to our new linked list and return.
big O : O(max(length of list 1,lenght of list 2))


intersection

#Use a Dictionary to keep all items of list 1,
#Then check items of list 2 are belong to this dictionary of not.
#If yes, we put it to new list and remove it out from dictionary (because list 2 can have duplicate items)
#Then return new linked list

big O : O(max(length of list 1,lenght of list 2))
